%%timefilter
    %Filters a sounding data structure by year and month. Given a soundings
    %data structure and a structure containing a span of years and an array
    %of months, timefilter destroys all data that lies outside the span of
    %years, and destroys all data that corresponds to the months within the
    %filter_settings structure.
    %timefilter returns as output a structure identical to the original
    %structure, except that the requested data has been removed.
    %
    %General form: [sounding] = timefilter(sndng,filter_settings)
    %
    %Outputs:
    %sndng: a soundings data structure filtered by years and months
    %
    %Inputs:
    %sndng: a sounding data structure as created by IGRAimpf
    %filter_settings: a structure with two fields; one which is a 1x2 array
    %giving a SPAN OF YEARS which will be RETAINED, and one which is a 1xX
    %array giving the INDIVIDUAL MONTHS which will be REMOVED
    %
    %Example of filter_settings:
    %filter_settings.year = [2002 2016] removes all data outside of 2002-2016 (inclusive)
    %filter_settings.month = [5,6,7,8,9] removes all data from May, June, July, August, and September

    %To-do: change to work with structures from start to finish, instead of
    %the current struct2table/table2struct setup.
