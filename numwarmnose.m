%%numwarmnose
    %Script to divide up a sounding dataset by the number of layers above 0 degC
    %present in the sounding. (Due to some flaws in how nosedetect
    %treats these, this is very good but imperfect; fixing these
    %unusual cases is a high priority goal.)
    %numwarmnose has been left as a script because many of the variables are 
    %useful for analysis, and an inconvenient number of outputs would need 
    %to be designated to make this work as a function.
    %
    %The most useful variables, in my experience, are:
    %onenose: contains numwarmnose=1
    %twonose: contains numwarmnose=2
    %threenose: contains numwarmnose=3
    %nannose: contains numwarmnose=NaN
    %
    %To create an appropriate soundings data structure, see fullIGRAimp.
